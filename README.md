# ASL Letter Translator
Link to Web App:   

Built a convolutional neural network to classify images of letters from American Sign Language:   

Training Data downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet   

All data loading, model designing, and training of the model takes place in ASL Translator.ipynb   

In this notebook, after loading, examining, and preprocessing the data I trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters and then tested its performance.   

I then implemented the trained model (model.pth) in a web app to be able to classify ASL letters being signed in real time.
