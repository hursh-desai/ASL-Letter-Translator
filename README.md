# ASL Letter Translator
Link to Web App:   

Built a convolutional neural network to classify images of letters from American Sign Language:   

In this notebook, after loading, examining, and preprocessing the data I trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters and then tested its performance.   

I then implemented the trained model in a web app to predict the ASL letter being signed using newly created data.   

All data loading, model designing, and training of the model takes place in ASL Translator.ipynb
